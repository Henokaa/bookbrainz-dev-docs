So you've decided to contribute some code to BookBrainz?
Fantastic! Thank you!

Here are some instruction to get your local coding environment set up.

Dependencies
============

BookBrainz is composed of:


* a NodeJS-based web server
* a PostgresQL database
* a Redis server to store user sessions
* an ElasticSearch server to handle search

The standard way to run these dependencies is using Docker.

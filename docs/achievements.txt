Achievement System

Introduction
============

The BookBrainz achievement system is a method of encouraging users to contribute to the database. The list of achievements will be available publicly but some ideas of the achievements that will be supplied are available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yuFMTVifYiyoiTS73TcaneNlQKLe6_gX0xtgksB4o4s/edit?usp=sharing)

How It Works
============

There are two basic types of achievement supplied by the system. Most of them will be awarded automatically by checking upon submission of a form by the user. Since achievements can only be awarded for certain types of interaction we can avoid checking all of them and only check relavant ones for each type of form. The other type are awarded manually by way of an admin console.

Achievements belong to "Tracks", that progressively get harder as levels are unlocked with new badges upon completion of a level. On completion of a track a title will be awarded which can be viewed on the profile page on on hover of a username elsewhere on the site.
